  # a)  Make file descriptor 7 a copy of the original stdout
  # b)  Redirect stdout to the original stderr.
  # c)  Redirect stderr to a temporary FD that is passed to the stdin of a tee
  #     subcommand. This writes all its input to the log file and to the stdout
  #     inherited from its parent. But the parent stdout is currently pointing
  #     at the original stderr.
  # d)  Restore stdout to the original stdout (currently pointed to by FD 7).
  # e)  Redirect stdout to another tee command. This command's stdout is the
  #     original stdout.
  # f)  We're done with FD 7, so close it.
  #
  # The end result of all this is that the stdout and stderr of the etcdctl
  # command go to same place as if we hadn't done any of this, but they are also
  # captured to the log file.
  #
  # We also save off the status code from etcdctl so it can be logged and
  # returned. Despite all our shenanigans we've only run one command in this
  # shell, so $? does indeed contain the exit code from etcdctl.
