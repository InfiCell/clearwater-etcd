    This is the base class for config type.
    All subclasses need the variables: name, filetype and help_info. All
    subclasses with filetype json or xml also need schema for use with
    validation.

    name - Users will reference the config type as this on the command line,
    eg. `cw-config download [name]` It is the name of the config file in
    clearwater-etcdctl and is used for this purpose too.

    help_info - Appears as user-visible help text in the usage statement for
    cw-config.

    filetype - Used to pick which validation scripts to use. Different
    config_types take different inputs to being called for validation.

    file_download_name - Used to agree with the current naming system when
    writing to file.

    schema - Used with those config types that require validation to say
    where the vaildation schema can be found.
